## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your 42 School computer.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/42-school-toolkit.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the toolkit directory.

    ```bash
    cd 42Initializer
    ```

3. Run the script and let the magic happen!

    ```bash
    ./42Initializer.sh
    ```
    If your present working directory ($PWD) is not $HOME, the program will prompt you with two menu options:

    - **Home Directory:** Choose this option if you want to move to $HOME before downloading dependencies.
    
    - **Current Directory:** Choose this option if you want to stay in your directory to download. **Note: This may cause issues.**

4. Install what you need.
    For each program, you will be prompted to choose whether you want to download it or not.
